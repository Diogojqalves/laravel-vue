Controller (app/http) are classes with methods bound to routes (web.php) that handle requests and send responses seen in the browser
Good to organize the app logic

- Create a Controller on the terminal:
    php artisan make:controller IndexController
    php artisan route:list

Model responsible to manage data

- Display Vue Component
Resources -> JS -> Pages

- Generate a Model (used to interact with database)
    php artisan make:model Listing -make
    (-m creates a migration file, found in database/migrations)

(*check App/Models)
    php artisan migrate
    (runs the migrate folder and creates the schemas/tables)

to had migrations manually
    php artisan make:migration add_fields_to_listings_table
check status
    php artisan migrate:status
rollback command
    php artisan migrate:rollback

- Generate dummy data for the Model
    terminal: php artisan make:factory ListingFactory
    check database/factories and configure the ListingFactory.php to define how the model shoould look like
    use Seeder @database/seeders to use the ModelFactory and generate the fake data
    terminal: php artisan db:seed

if error -> php artisan migrate:refresh (carefull because it deletes the whole schema)
to delete -> php artisan migrate:refresh --seed

- Query the database
    terminal: php artisan tinker
                *get
                Listing::all() // to select *
                Listing::find(15)
                Listing::where('beds', '>', 4)->get()
                Listing::where('beds', '>', 4)->where('area', '>', 200)->get()
                Listing::where('beds', '>=', 4)->orderBy('price', 'asc')->get()
                Listing::where('beds', '>=', 4)->orderBy('price', 'asc')->first()

                *update
                Listing::find(15)
                $listing->city= 'Porto'
                $listing->save()

                *insert
                $listing = Listing::create(['city' => 'Porto', ...])


- Resource Controller (used to focus a Controller on a specific resource / eloquent Model)
    
    terminal:  php artisan make:controller --resource ListingController
                (creates the file Where we define the controller methods)
    on the app:
        web.php (configure controller routes)
            Route::resource('listing', ListingController::class);

- Middleware (runned before any http request, used to verify the user and its permissions)
    Middleware class gets two arguments (request and the next method)
    - with the request we can check if it has a token and its value
    
    on the terminal:
        php artisan inertia:middleware (it will publish inertia middleware class)
    on the Middleware\Kernel.php
        add the middleware namespace
    on the Inertia Middleware config share method
